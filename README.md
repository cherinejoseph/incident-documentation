# Incident Handler's Journal: Ransomware Attack Simulation

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Incident Handler's Journal** project. In this simulation, we document a **ransomware attack** that affected a small U.S. health care clinic. The journal outlines the incident response process from detection to resolution, following best practices in cybersecurity. This project demonstrates how an **incident handler** would document a cybersecurity incident in a structured format, helping to ensure that critical steps and evidence are preserved.

The ransomware attack is triggered by a **phishing email** containing a malicious attachment that encrypts sensitive patient data, rendering the clinic's operations inoperable. Through this documentation, we will track the response steps, the tools used, and the lessons learned throughout the incident lifecycle.

This repository contains detailed entries about the steps taken during the incident response, as well as relevant files that simulate the **incident handler's journal**.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Scenario**:  
   Read through the detailed incident scenario provided in this project. The scenario involves a **ransomware attack** on a small U.S. health care clinic, which you will document and respond to as an incident handler.

2. **Follow the Incident Handler’s Journal Template**:  
   Each journal entry documents an important part of the incident response process. Follow the template to record each step carefully, from the first discovery of the incident through recovery.

3. **Fill in the Required Sections**:
   - **Date**: Enter the current date when you are documenting the journal.
   - **Entry Number**: Start with entry #1 and increment for each subsequent entry.
   - **Description**: Provide a short description of the event or action taken.
   - **Tool(s) Used**: Mention any cybersecurity tools or methods used to handle the incident.
   - **The 5 W's**: Use the **5 W's** (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to clearly answer the key questions about the incident.
   - **Additional Notes**: Add any further observations or thoughts about the incident that could help in the investigation or post-incident review.

4. **Review Journal Entries**:  
   Each journal entry should be detailed but concise, providing an accurate record of actions taken. Make sure to document both the immediate steps (such as isolating affected systems) and any strategic decisions made (such as engaging with external cybersecurity teams).

5. **Keep it Structured**:  
   Use the provided format to ensure your entries are consistent, clear, and easy to follow.

## Scenario: Ransomware Attack on a Health Care Clinic

### Incident Overview:

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

### Attack Vector:
The attackers gained access to the clinic's network through **targeted phishing emails** sent to several employees. These emails contained a **malicious attachment**. When the attachment was downloaded and opened, it triggered the installation of **ransomware** on the employees' computers.

### Impact:
Once the ransomware was deployed, the attackers encrypted the clinic's **critical files**, including **patient data** and medical records. This rendered the clinic's systems inoperable, causing significant **business disruption**. The clinic had to **shut down its systems** immediately to prevent further damage and started reaching out to other organizations for technical support and incident response assistance.

### Attackers' Profile:
The attackers are an **organized group of unethical hackers** known for targeting organizations in the healthcare and transportation industries. They used **social engineering** (via phishing) and malware to infiltrate the clinic’s systems, ultimately deploying ransomware to encrypt the data.

## Steps Taken in Response to the Incident

### Step 1: **Access the Template**
- **Action Taken**: The first step involved setting up a structured **incident handler’s journal** template to document the entire incident response process. This template ensures that all steps taken, tools used, and key decisions are recorded consistently.

### Step 2: **Review the Scenario**
- **Action Taken**: The incident handler reviewed the details of the scenario, which involved a **ransomware attack** impacting a small U.S. health care clinic. The key facts were carefully considered:
  - The **time of the attack**: Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.
  - The **cause**: A phishing email containing a malicious attachment.
  - The **attackers**: An organized group of unethical hackers targeting healthcare and transportation industries.
  - The **impact**: Encrypted files and disrupted business operations.

### Step 3: **Record Journal Entry #1**
- **Action Taken**: The first journal entry was created to document the discovery of the incident. The following sections were filled out:
  - **Date**: [Insert current date]  
  - **Entry Number**: 1
  - **Description**: Initial discovery of the ransomware attack, with employees unable to access critical files and a ransom note displayed.
  - **Tool(s) Used**:  
    - Email filtering tools (to check for phishing email)
    - Antivirus software (for initial malware scan)
    - Incident tracking system (to document the event)
  - **The 5 W's**:
    - **Who**: Organized group of hackers targeting the healthcare sector.
    - **What**: A phishing email with a malicious attachment deployed ransomware that encrypted clinic files.
    - **When**: The incident occurred on Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m.
    - **Where**: The incident occurred at a small U.S. health care clinic.
    - **Why**: The phishing attack exploited vulnerabilities in email security and employee awareness.
  - **Additional Notes**:
    - Initial findings suggest that the ransomware encrypted sensitive medical records and patient data.
    - The clinic had to shut down its systems, and emergency response measures were put in place.
    - Further investigation and containment are required.
